# Docs_On_The_Blockchain

Django2 middleware, serving HTML and JavaScript files to interact (using web3.js) with the smart contract.
Nodejs used to deploy and test contract.

Abstract: Create document sharing system that would save the user's work from censorship/forced-deletion. Also give users the option to store documents in an encrypted state, so that if the information is sensitive, the document cannot be read from the blockchain.
